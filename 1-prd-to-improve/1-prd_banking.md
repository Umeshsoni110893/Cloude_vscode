**Author:** Product Team  
**Last Updated:** April 25, 2026  
**Status:** Approved for Development

## 1. Overview

This document defines the requirements for core account management functionality within our retail banking platform. The scope includes account creation, user authentication, account overview, funds transfer, and transaction history. These features are foundational to the customer-facing digital banking experience.

Our goal is to provide customers with full visibility and control over their accounts while maintaining the security standards expected of a regulated financial institution. The platform must serve both individual and joint account holders.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 User Authentication & Session Management

**Description:**  
Customers must be able to securely log in to their accounts using their credentials. Given the sensitivity of financial data, authentication requirements are stricter than a standard consumer application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users log in with a username (or registered email) and password.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all users. The supported methods are SMS OTP and an authenticator app.
- After a number of consecutive failed login attempts, the account is locked and the customer must contact support or go through a recovery flow to regain access.
- Sessions automatically expire after a period of inactivity. The user receives a warning before the session ends.
- Users logging in from an unrecognized device are prompted for additional verification.
- Concurrent sessions from multiple devices should be handled gracefully. The expected behavior when a user logs in on a new device while already logged in elsewhere should be defined per platform policy.
- Users can view and terminate active sessions from their security settings page.

### 2.2 Account Overview Dashboard

**Description:**  
Upon login, customers are presented with a dashboard displaying a summary of all their accounts. This is the primary entry point for all account activity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The dashboard displays all accounts associated with the customer (e.g., checking, savings, loan accounts).
- Each account tile shows: account type, masked account number, current balance, and available balance.
- Customers can select any account to view its full details and transaction history.
- The dashboard refreshes automatically to reflect the latest balance. The refresh interval will be determined during implementation.
- Accounts with restricted status (frozen, pending review) are displayed with an appropriate indicator, but the customer can still view balances.
- Joint account holders see the same account information. Permissions for joint holders are governed by account setup, and the rules for what joint holders can and cannot do should be addressed separately.

### 2.3 Funds Transfer

**Description:**  
Customers can transfer funds between their own accounts, to other customers within the platform, and to external bank accounts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Internal transfers (between a customer's own accounts) are processed immediately.
- Transfers to other customers on the platform are completed within the same business day.
- External transfers (ACH) are subject to standard processing times and the customer is shown an estimated completion date.
- Customers can schedule transfers for a future date or set up recurring transfers on a defined frequency.
- Transfer limits apply per transaction and per day. Customers are notified if a transfer would exceed their limit, and they may request a limit increase through the app.
- A confirmation step is required before any transfer is submitted. The customer must review transfer details and explicitly confirm.
- For transfers above a certain amount, additional verification may be required.
- Transfer history is accessible from the account activity view.

### 2.4 Transaction History

**Description:**  
Customers can view, search, and export their transaction history for any of their accounts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Transactions are displayed in reverse chronological order by default.
- Each transaction entry includes: date, description, amount (debit/credit), and running balance.
- Customers can filter transactions by date range, transaction type, and amount range.
- A search function allows customers to look up transactions by keyword or merchant name.

### 2.5 Profile & Security Settings

**Description:**  
Customers can manage their personal information and security preferences from a dedicated settings area.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Customers can update their contact information: email address, phone number, and mailing address.
- Changes to sensitive fields (email, phone) trigger a verification step using the existing verified contact method.
- Customers can change their password. The new password must meet current security standards.
